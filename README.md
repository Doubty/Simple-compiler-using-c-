# Simple-compiler-using-c-
This is a just a simple compiler that I have created to the subject of compilers of my university as a form to obtain the note of the first unity. In this project i'm using c++, cmake to create the makefile, makefile to apoint the files who will be compiles and gbd, as well i'm using vscode and its tasks to improve the process  of compile, test and debug.
